  my girlfriend's favorite website, my study life, recently updated to a broken, non user-friendly version lacking her favorite original features. so i built this site for her to keep track of her assignments and to-dos. i will update this readme soon.

the site features a my study life clone assignment tracker, a to-do list, and a pomodoro timer.
